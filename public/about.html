  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Somalia,[a] officially the Federal Republic of Somalia,[b] is the easternmost country in continental Africa. Stretching across the Horn of Africa, it borders Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti[19] to the northwest, Kenya to the southwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, and the Indian Ocean to the east. Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland.[20] Somalia has an estimated population of 18.1 million,[21][22][23] of which 2.7 million live in the capital and largest city, Mogadishu.

<p>One of Africa's most ethnically homogenous countries, around 85% of Somalia's residents are ethnic Somalis. The official languages of the country are Somali and Arabic, though Somali is the primary language. Somalia has historic and religious ties to the Arab world.[24] The people are Muslims, adherents of the Sunni branch.[25][26]</p>
